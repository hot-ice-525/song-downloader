**BACKSTORY**

Call me old school but when it comes to listening songs; apart from listening them online on Spotify, I love
to keep them downloaded on my device, so a bad network won't stop me from listening my favourite songs. So occasionally
when I visit some websites for downloading songs, they have a couple of download links and some of them are just
simple redirects to other websites or even sometimes Youtube videos! I guess website owners have sponsers from them and
they just want more clicks.Quite an unethical way you can say, but whatever, I was fed up with this and wanted a solution
for it. That's why I decided to pick up this project.

**WHAT DOES IT DO?**

It is a simple extension that provides you with the acutal download link, so you can peacefully download your favourite
song without going through any hassle of fake redirects.

**HOW DOES IT WORK?**

It simply scans all the available audio elements that have an href attribute ending in ".mp3". In most of the cases, these
are the actual download links that you were originally looking for!
